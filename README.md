# Mastermind
A command line game implementation of [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) written in C.

# Usage
To run this application, simply download the release and run in directly or by using Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. Otherwise, you may compile the C file using GCC.

***Cheat code:*** To reveal the correct answer, enter the code `10302000` into the code guessing input.

# Notes
Since I made this for my freshman programming class back in December 2019, the code and practices involved may not reflect best practices. I believe there is also a bug wherein entering the "cheat code" may cause the program not to immediately recognize the correct answer of the first player that enters it.
